/*
MongoDB states the following about ObjectId:
- a 4-byte timestamp value, representing the ObjectIdâ€™s creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch
- a 5-byte random value
- a 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value

The 5-byte random value may trick you to believe that its hard to guess the next id from the previous one but its not:

- a 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch (which will not run out of seconds until the year 2106)
- a 3-byte machine identifier (usually derived from the MAC address),
- a 2-byte process id, and
- a 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.

This implementation will return a random ObjectId instead.
- a 4-byte timestamp value
- a 2-byte process id
- a 6-byte random value
